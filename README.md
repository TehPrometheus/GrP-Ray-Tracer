outline:
* We raytrace primitives like spheres and planes using a fixed camera and simple material
* We implement the camera and add basic shadows
* We implement more complex, physically based lighting (PBR)
* We expand to raytrace trianglemeshes
* We optimize using multithreading techniques and acceleration structures

# Graphics Production Course Project: Ray Tracer
A custom ray tracer developed in C++ from the ground up for the Graphics Production Course at the DAE school.

## Spheres & Planes
First we write out the code for a basic raytracer using a fixed camera and simple material on primitives like spheres and planes.
